# Startup Generator

I built this by following tutorials & documentation written by Google (https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab) in order to get a grounding in Flutter.

Flutter is still in its early days and highly experimental, meaning some features don't work yet - though is really exciting as a new technology as it allows devolpers to create iOS, Android & Web applications all from the same code - and without having to style for each device individually. Not to mention their "Hot Reload" function!
